# fragile_families

Introduction:

Our project focuses on the relationship between the mental health status of low-income parents and behavioral and educational outcomes of their children. We use the Fragile Families dataset, a longitudinal study of children born in 20 large cities across the United States, to study how symptoms of depression of mothers living in poverty affects GPA and grit of their children. While there is ample research linking poverty to poor educational outcomes, we were curious about the interactions between poverty and depression in parents, and to what extent that particular hardship manifests in children.
